# Stratum

My personal design system for anything tailwind-esque. Heavily influenced by `@skeletonlabs/skeleton` for its creative way of handling colors among other things.

## Theme

Color Sets: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, and `surface`.
Color Shades: default `50 - 950`.

### Theme Requirements

Each color set should have a complete color shade and it's contrast definitions as `@theme inline` variables.
